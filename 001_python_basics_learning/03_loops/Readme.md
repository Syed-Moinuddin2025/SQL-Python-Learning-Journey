## 🚀 Practice Goals

- Understand `for` vs `while` loops
- Use `break`, `continue`, and conditionals inside loops
- Practice real-world logic patterns
- Build habits for clean and readable code

---

## 🧠 Tips

- Add input validation for user-driven problems
- Print debug values while learning
- Try to rewrite each problem in both `for` and `while` loop styles
